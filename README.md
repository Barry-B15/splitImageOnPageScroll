# Split Image On Page Scroll
This is a CSS, HTML, Vanilla JS page.
The page breaks like an eggshell when scrolled and begins to show the content as you scroll along.
The broken up image pulls to the two sides of the screen as you scroll along until it all disappears
showing only the page content. 

# Technology Used.
It uses just HTML, CSS and Vanilla javascript on Clip Path Maker by Bennett Feely. I got inspiration
for this from watching a Youtube video by Online Tutorials, one of the best CSS teachers on  the web
in my opinion.
